### 1. Install NickelMenu: https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu/#install
This enables the options to add your own options and run scripts dircetly from the kobo device, like reconnecting to the PC via USB after having ejected the device.

### 2. Install NickelSeries: https://pgaskin.net/kepubify/ns/
This adds support for series grouping when combined with Calibre.

### 3. After having installed both of those, copy `nm/config` and `nm/.icon.png` to `KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/`
This will add my own options to nickel menu, like turning wallpaper mode on or off without having to connect to the PC first.

For wallpapers to work, create a `screensaver` directory inside `/Volumes/KOBOeReader/.kobo/`. Then, you have to put your pictures inside `/Volumes/KOBOeReader/.kobo/screensaver/`. You can resize the pictures to the perfect size with this tool: https://www.ebookscreensaver.com/

### Note
Last time I installed it, the `KoboRoot.tgz` file from NickelMenu vanished after installing, but the `NickelSeries_v5-bf2db08.zip` from NickelSeries file stayed. I just left it as is, it's working fine.
